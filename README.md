## 👀 Description 👀
**The Manning Signs website has multiple purposes**
<p>
   Creating an easier way to Quote orders. Before this website all orders were done in-person or over the phone. This simplifies the process allowing the owner to specify the requirements of an order beforehand. This saves valuable time during the work day.  
    Gives the owners a Point Of Sale. This new revenue stream will take the place of an outdated system of selling shirts and election signs through a singular facebook post. This online store is centered around commerce.js API. CommerceJS offers a back-end solution for the store and gallery. The checkout form and checkout information are built utilizing StripeJS software.
